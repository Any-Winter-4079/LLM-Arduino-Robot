GSM8K v2 Solver
Tests large language models on the GSM8K math dataset with multiple reasoning methods and self-consistency.
Features:
- Support for Chain of Thought, Program-Aided Language Models and Declarative reasoning
- Self-consistency evaluation with multiple iterations
- Answer selection through unanimous, mode-based, or sampling strategies
- Improved performance over previous versions (CoT: 0.593→0.719, Dec: 0.553→0.572, PAL: 0.679→0.782)
- Modular organization with separate configuration, methods, and utilities
- Support for custom GSM8K datasets to reduce contamination concerns
- Flexible method selection and iteration count configuration

# Description   #
#################
# The script is v2 of the LLM tester for the GSM8K dataset, CoT_Dec_PAL_tester_v1.py.
# This version improves:
# CoT: 0.593 (1337 seed) -> 0.719 using 5-iter SC (Self-Consistency) [Fastest per iteration].
# Dec: 0.553 (1337 seed) -> 0.572 (1337 seed) using more robust SymPy equations extraction.
# PAL: 0.679 (1337 seed) -> 0.782 using 5-iter SC (Self-Consistency) [Best result].
# You can choose one or more methods to test, each with one or more iterations (seeds) using SC.
# For example, you can test the PAL method with 6 iterations (seeds), or the PAL method with 3 iterations (seeds)
# and the CoT method with 3 iterations (seeds), for a total of 6 iterations (and thus results) to choose from.
# Dec(with Simpy) is not tested with SC in my results because it is slower than the other methods (but it could be done).

# /results: Contains the results of the tests (starting with v2).
# Earlier versions do not, but later versions have the decider's way of selecting the answer added in the log, from:
# unanimous (all SC iterations agree on the same answer), sampling (no SC iteration agrees on the same answer,
# or there is a tied-mode, so sampling is used), or mode (there is a most common answer, so that one is used).
# Early exiting is not implemented (for example if already 3 out of 5 agree), but is planned for the next version.
# There exists a fourth way to decide implemented (Decider.py), via LLM, but did not work well, as it chose
# answers outside the given pool of options, so it is not used in the results. There is a way to constrain the
# LLM to a set of options, and that might be the way to go for the Decider, but it is not implemented yet.

# Organization also improves:
# /config/v2/config.py: Contains the configuration for the script.
# /methods/v2: Contains the methods to run the LLM (CoT, Dec, PAL) and an LLM Decider.
# /utils/v2/utils.py: Contains utility functions to load exemplars, save results, and select the best response.

# To run the LLM, the script uses the Llama C++ library and the Llama Python wrapper (you can choose which one to use).
# https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp
# https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python
# Make sure to have llama.cpp in /LLM as well as have llama-cpp-python installed.

# A custom GSM8K dataset is created, so far with only 40 pairs of questions and answers, to test models alternatively, as contamination
# from GSM8K leaking into the training data might have tainted some models. The questions include set theory, probability, and so on,
# so they are not the exact type of questions the original GSM8K dataset has, but they are similar enough to test the models.
# /datasets/custom_gsm8k.json: Contains the custom GSM8K dataset.
