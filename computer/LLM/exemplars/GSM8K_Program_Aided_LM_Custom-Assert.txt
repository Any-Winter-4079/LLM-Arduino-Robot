Task:
    - Solve the given problem(s) in a careful, formal manner.

Rules:
    - The function to solve the problem(s) should be written in Python and be named solution.
    - The function should not take any arguments.
    - The function should return a result variable placed at the end of the function.
    - All variables used in the solution should be defined within the function.

Strategy:
    - Break Down the Problem: Divide the problem into smaller, manageable parts or steps, addressing each part with clear, focused logic.
    - Validate Logic with Examples: Before coding, manually work through examples or scenarios to ensure your understanding and approach are correct.
    - Independent Validation for Assertions: Where possible, base assertions on calculations or checks that are independent of the solution's logic, such as validating results against known constraints or using a different method to estimate the expected range of results.

Common Mistakes in Problem Solving and What to Do:
    - Mistake: Missing or Overlooking Problem Elements
    - What to Do: Carefully read the problem statement to identify all elements and their relationships. Create a checklist of all identified elements and ensure each is addressed in the solution.
    - Mistake: Sticking to the first solution approach without considering others.
    - What to Do: Brainstorm different methods to solve the problem before deciding on the most efficient or simplest solution. Comparing multiple approaches can uncover hidden complexities or simpler paths.
    - Mistake: Misinterpreting Scenario or Requirements
    - What to Do: Paraphrase the problem and its requirements in your own words. Validate your understanding against the problem statement.
    - Mistake: Incorrect Unit Conversions or Handling
    - What to Do: Explicitly note each quantity's units and ensure consistent units are used throughout calculations.
    - Mistake: Combining Variables Improperly
    - What to Do: Define separate variables for distinct elements, even if they play similar roles in the problem.

Common Mistakes in Assertions and What to Do:
    - Mistake: The assertion directly replicates the calculation steps of the solution.
    - What to Do: Use assertions to check outcomes against independent expectations or constraints, not to mirror the solution's process.
    - Mistake: Assertions do not address critical conditions outlined in the problem.
    - What to Do: For each problem statement, identify invariants or essential conditions and ensure at least one assertion verifies each.
    - Mistake: Assertions validate the result based on an assumption that deviates from the problem's constraints or real-world logic.
    - What to Do: Double-check each assertion against the problem statement to ensure it's grounded in the problem's reality, not assumed logic.

The questions are as follows:

Q: Mario and Luigi together had 10 years of experience in soccer. Luigi had 3 more than Mario. How many did Mario have?
A: 
def solution():
    """
    Problem Breakdown and Strategy:
    - Total experience together: 10 years
    - Luigi's experience is 3 years more than Mario's.
    - Goal: Determine Mario's years of experience.
    
    Solution Steps:
    1. Let Mario's experience be x years.
    2. Then, Luigi's experience is x + 3 years.
    3. Given that together they have 10 years of experience, set up the equation: x + (x + 3) = 10
    4. Solve the equation for x to find Mario's years of experience.
    
    Common Mistakes and Corrections:
    - Ensure the equation correctly represents the problem statement.
    - Solve the equation accurately, avoiding arithmetic errors.
    - Use assertions to validate the relationship between Mario's and Luigi's experiences relative to the total.

Q: The planet Goob completes one revolution after every 2 weeks. How many hours will it take for it to complete half a revolution?
A:

    Problem Breakdown and Strategy:

    Solution Steps:
    1. Convert the full revolution time from weeks to hours.
    2. Calculate the time for half a revolution by dividing the total hours by 2.
    
    Common Mistakes and Corrections:
    - Ensure accurate unit conversion from weeks to hours.
    - Precisely calculate half the revolution time, avoiding rounding errors.
    - Use assertions to validate the conversion process and final result.
