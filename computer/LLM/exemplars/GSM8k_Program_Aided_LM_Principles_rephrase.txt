First rephrase, then answer, the following problem:
The planet Goob completes one revolution after every 2 weeks. How many hours will it take for it to complete half a revolution?

Problem rephrased:
The planet Goob orbits completely around its star in 2 weeks. Half a revolution would mean that the planet has reached the halfway point in its orbit. The question asks for the time it takes for the planet to complete half a revolution.

Answer:
def solution():
    one_revolution_week = 2
    half_revolution_week = one_revolution_week/2
    half_revolution_hour = half_revolution_week * 7 * 24
    result = half_revolution_hour
    return result
