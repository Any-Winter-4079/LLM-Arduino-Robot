{user_start}{user_lead_message}Jason had 20 lollipops. He gave Denny some lollipops. Now Jason has 12 lollipops. How many lollipops did Jason give to Denny?{user_end}
{assistant_start}Problem rephrased:
Jason initially possessed 20 lollipops, but after giving some to Denny, he's left with 12 lollipops. The question is asking how many lollipops Jason gave to Denny.

Answer:
The difference between the number of lollipops Jason had initially and the number he has now will give us the number of lollipops he gave to Denny. So, we need to subtract the current number of lollipops (12) from the initial number (20).

Jason gave Denny (20 - 12) = 8 lollipops.

{user_start}{user_lead_message}There were nine computers in the server room. Five more computers were installed each day, from monday to thursday. How many computers are now in the server room?{user_end}
{assistant_start}Problem rephrased:
Initially, the server room had 9 computers. From Monday to Thursday, 5 computers were added each day. The question is asking for the current number of computers in the server room.

Answer:
The addition of computers happened over four days, so we add the number of computers installed each day to the initial number. This gives us:

Number of computers = Initial number + (Computers installed on Monday + Computers installed on Tuesday + Computers installed on Wednesday + Computers installed on Thursday)
= 9 + (5 + 5 + 5 + 5)
= 9 + 20
= 29

So, there are now 29 computers in the server room.
The answer is 29.{assistant_end}
{user_start}{user_lead_message}Michael had 58 golf balls. On tuesday, he lost 23 golf balls. On wednesday, he lost 2 more. How many golf balls did he have at the end of wednesday?{user_end}
{assistant_start}Problem rephrased:
Michael's initial collection consisted of 58 golf balls. Over the course of two days, he lost a total of 23 balls on Tuesday and an additional 2 balls on Wednesday. The question asks for the number of golf balls Michael had left after both of these days.

Answer:
To answer the problem, we first need to account for the balls Michael lost on Tuesday, which leaves him with 58 - 23 = 35 balls. Then, we need to account for the balls he lost on Wednesday, which leaves him with 35 - 2 = 33 balls. Therefore, Michael had 33 golf balls remaining at the end of Wednesday.
The answer is 33.{assistant_end}
{user_start}{user_lead_message}Olivia has $23. She bought five bagels for $3 each. How much money does she have left?{user_end}
{assistant_start}Problem rephrased:
Olivia's initial amount of money is $23. She spends $3 on each of five bagels. How much money does Olivia have remaining?

Answer:
First, calculate the total cost of the bagels: 5 bagels * $3/bagel = $15.
Then, subtract this amount from Olivia's initial money to find out how much she has left: $23 - $15 = $8.
So, Olivia has $8 left after buying the bagels.
The answer is 8.{assistant_end}
