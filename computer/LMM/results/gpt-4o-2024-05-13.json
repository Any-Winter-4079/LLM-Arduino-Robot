The arrow indicates that you should follow the lane to the left.\n2. **Speed**: Adjust to a safe speed for turning. Assuming you generally move at a moderate pace, set your speed to around 100 - 150 (this depends on your normal speed during straight travel). This"

In this image, the lane is curving to the right. \n\nThus, your next move should be to steer right. Given that it is a fairly sharp curve, you should make a significant right turn but not too abrupt to avoid possibly missing the lane. A moderate speed is advisable to maintain control.\n\nSo, I recommend:\n- **Direction**: Right\n- **Speed**: 150\n\n"

Therefore, you should continue moving straight ahead.\n\nFor speed, since there are no immediate curves or obstacles visible, you can proceed at a moderate speed, which I would suggest to be around 200. This allows you to advance quickly while still being able to adjust if changes in the lane's direction happen suddenly.\n\nSo, the next move should be:\n- Direction: Straight ahead\n- Speed"
